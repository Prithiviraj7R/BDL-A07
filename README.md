## Monitoring FastAPI application using Prometheus and Grafana

The problem involves enhancing an existing FastAPI application by integrating Prometheus monitoring to track API usage and monitor application health. Additionally, Grafana visualization will be added to analyze Prometheus metrics effectively. The process includes dockerizing the application after ensuring its functionality in a single instance and then scaling it to multiple instances (cluster) for improved performance, with a focus on monitoring the cluster's health throughout the deployment.
